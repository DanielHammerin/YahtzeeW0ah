# YahtzeeW0ah

                Welcome to the Yahtzee game

HOW TO RUN: In order to launch the application, you will have to clone it using the github link, open the project in your IDE and run the main class that exists in the src folder ( right under view package ).


WHAT WE DID: Me and daniel implemented the game yahtzee, following the instructions provided in the assignment on the coursepress page. We tried to follow Object Oriented Design as much as we could as well as implement as many requerments as we could. 

The one requierment we were unable to implement was the computer AI system as we found it too complicated and hard to do, specially considering the time we had to complete this assignment. 

Another thing you might notice in your database class ( DB ) is that we tried to use serializable to implement the save/load game function, but it didnt work out very well since we had too little knowlage of how it works, so we used an arraylist instead.
