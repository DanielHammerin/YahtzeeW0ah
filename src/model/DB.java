/**
 * In this class we have created methods to
 * help with saving the game  as well as loading it. We tried using Serializable
 * to save the game to a file, but came to the conclusion that using an arraylist
 * was a much simpler and fail-free solution, specially since we have too little
 * knowledge in how serializable works.
 * This however means that saving and loading can only be done as long as the program is executing.
